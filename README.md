# Express framework starter

Node.js/Express template application which I use as a base for creating API web services. I spent quite a lot of time on  investigating different tutorials and projects and for that moment I think that this project structure is good for such kind of applications.

### Stuff used to make this:

* [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/i0natan/nodebestpractices)
* [Express' application generator](https://github.com/expressjs/generator) source code
* Many tutorials and blog posts

### Current state:
It can be used as a base for a project. I am still working on improving some details.

### TODO:
* Replace `debug` with `pino-debug` package
* Add process manager
* Add testing framework
